<p>Getting started with the Android WebView is fairly simple, whether you want load 
a remote URL or display pages stored in your app.</p>

<p>This tutorial walks you through creating a new Android Project, adding a 
WebView, loading a remote URL and then loading a local HTML page. </p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This tutorial assumes you're a developer with limited 
or no experience with the Android development environment, but have some experience with Java. 
If you're already familiar with programming for Android, you may want to refer to to

<p>This tutorial uses <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">Android 
Studio</a>, the new 
design-and-build IDE for Android. So you&#8217;ll need start off by installing Android 
Studio, as described here:</p>

## Add the WebView

Android Studio will give you some boilerplate code to set up your application. Your project's 
structure should look something like this:

<img src="/multidevice/images/webview/projectlayout.png" alt=""/> 

A few of the more import files and folders:

<ol>
<li><code>src/main/java</code>. Android Java source code.</li>
<li><code>src/main/res</code>. Resources used by the native application.</li>
<li><code>src/main/res/drawable-<i>type</i></code>. Image resources used by the native 
application.</li>
<li><code>src/main/res/layout</code>. XML layout files that define the structure of UI 
components.</li>
<li><code>src/main/res/values</code>. Dimensions, strings, and other values that you might not want 
to hard-code in your application.</li>
<li><code>src/main/AndroidManifest.xml</code>. The manifest file defines what's included in the 
application: activities, permissions, themes, and so on.</li>
</ol>

You need to add a 
[WebView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html) to 
the main activity's layout.

1.  Open the `activity_main.xml` file in the `src/main/res/layout` directory if it 
    is not already open. (You may also see a `fragment_main.xml` file. You can ignore this, 
    as it's not required for this tutorial.)

    Select the **Text** tab at the bottom of the of the `activity_main.xml` editor to see 
    the XML markup.

    <img src="/multidevice/images/webview/xmllayout.png" alt=""/> 

    This file defines the layout for your main activity, and the **Preview** panes show the
    a preview of the activity. The **Blank Activity** layout doesn't include any children. 
    You'll need to add the WebView.

2.  In the XML markup, add the &lt;WebView&gt; element and a new closing tag, as shown:

    <pre>&lt;FrameLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
         xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
         android:id="@+id/container"
         android:layout_width="match_parent"
         android:layout_height="match_parent"
         tools:context=".MainActivity"
         tools:ignore="MergeRootFrame"<strong>>
             &lt;WebView
             android:id="@+id/activity_main_webview"
             android:layout_width="match_parent"
             android:layout_height="match_parent" /&gt;
    &lt;/FrameLayout&gt;</strong></pre>

    (Note that the **/>** at the end of the `FrameLayout` tag is replaced with **>** 
    since the tag now has contents.) 

4.  To use the WebView you need to reference it in the Activity. Open the Java 
    source file for the main activity, `MainActivity.java` in the 
    `src/main/java/<PackageName>` directory. 

    Add the lines shown in bold. 

    <pre>public class MainActivity extends Activity {
        <strong>
        private WebView mWebView;
        </strong>
        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
            <strong>
            mWebView = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.activity_main_webview);</strong>
    </pre>

    The existing code in the `onCreate` method does the work of hooking up the 
    Activity with the layout. The added lines create a new member variable, 
    `mWebView`, to refer to the web view. 

    Remove the following code:

    <pre>if (savedInstanceState == null) {
        getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
            .add(R.id.container, new PlaceholderFragment())
            .commit();
    }
    </pre>

    The WebView is identified by the resource ID, which is specified by this line in 
    the layout file:

        android:id="@+id/activity_main_webview"

    After adding the code, you'll see some warning messages in the margin of the editor.
    This is because you haven't imported the right classes for WebView. Luckily Android Studio can
    help you fill in the missing classes. The easiest way to do 
    this is click and hover over an unknown class name and wait for a popup 
    showing a "quick fix" -- in this case, adding an `import` statment for the `WebView` class.

    <img src="/multidevice/images/webview/quick-fix-popup.png" alt=""/> 

    Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (<kbd>Option</kbd> + </kbd>Enter</kbd> on Mac) to 
    accept the quick fix.

    WebView in hand you can move on to setting it up and and loading some juicy web 
    content.

## Enable JavaScript

WebViews don't allow JavaScript by default. To run a web application in the web 
view, you need to explicitly enable JavaScript.

1.  Add the following lines to the `onCreate` method:

    <pre><strong>// Enable Javascript
    WebSettings webSettings = mWebView.getSettings();
    webSettings.setJavaScriptEnabled(true);</strong>
    </pre>

2.  After entering the text, click on `WebSettings` and press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> 
    (<kbd>Option</kbd> + </kbd>Enter</kbd> on Mac) to add an import statement for `WebSettings`.

## Load a Remote URL

If you're going to load data from a remote URL, your application needs 
[permission](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html) 
to access the internet. This permission needs to be added in the [application's 
manifest 
file](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html). 

1.  Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file in the `src/res` directory. Add the line 
    in bold before the closing &lt;/manifest&gt; tag.

    <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    &lt;manifest ...>
    ...
    &nbsp;
        &lt;/application>
        <strong>
        &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
        </strong>
    &lt;/manifest>
    </pre>

2.  The next step is to call the `loadUrl` method on the webview. Add the following 
    line to the end of the `onCreate` method.

    <code><strong>mWebView.loadUrl("[http://beta.html5test.com/](http://beta.html5test.com/)");</strong></code>

    Now try running the project. If you don't have a device handy, you can create an emulator
    (AVD or Android Virtual Device) by going to **Tools** > **Android** > **AVD Manager**.

    <img src="/multidevice/images/webview/html5test.jpg" width="318" alt=""/>

<aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To detect when a URL has started and finished loading,
use 
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient.html#onPageStarted(android.webkit.WebView,%20java.lang.String,%20android.graphics.Bitmap)">
<code>WebViewClient.onPageStarted</code></a> and 
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient.html#onPageFinished(android.webkit.WebView,%20java.lang.String)">
<code>WebViewClient.onPageFinished</code>.</a>
</aside>

<h3 id="handling-navigation">Handling Navigation</h3>

<p>Now try changing the URL you&#8217;re loading to <code>http://www.html5rocks.com/</code> and rerun your application.
You&#8217;ll notice something strange.</p>

<p>If you run the application now with a site that has a redirect like <code>html5rocks.com</code>, 
your app ends up opening the site in a browser on 
the device, not in your WebView &#8211; probably not what you expected. This is 
because of the way the WebView handles navigation events.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the sequence of events:</p>

<ol>
<li>The WebView tries to load the original URL from the remote server, and gets a 
redirect to a new URL.</li>
<li>The WebView checks if the system can handle a view intent for the URL, if so 
the system handles the URL navigation, otherwise the WebView will navigate 
internally (i.e. the user has no browser installed on their device).</li>
<li>The system picks the user&#8217;s preferred application for handling an <code>http://</code> URL 
scheme &#8211; that is, the user&#8217;s default browser. If you have more than one browser installed,
you may see a dialog at this point.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/multidevice/images/webview/browser-selection.png&#8221; width="482&#8221; alt="browser selection dialog"/> </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using a WebView inside an Android application to display some simple 
web content (for example, a help page), this may be exactly what you want to do. 
However, for more sophisticated applications, you may want to handle the 
navigation links yourself.</p>

<p>To handle navigation inside the WebView you need to override the WebView&#8217;s <code>WebViewClient</code>, 
which handles various events generated by the WebView. You can use it to 
control how the WebView handles link clicks and page redirects.</p>

<p>The default implementation of <code>WebViewClient</code> makes <strong>any</strong> URL open in the WebView:</p>

<pre><strong>// Force links and redirects to open in the WebView instead of in a browser
mWebView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient());
</strong></pre>

This is a good step forward, but what if you want to handle links for your site 
only, while opening other URLs in a browser?

To achieve this you need to extend the `WebViewClient` class and implement the 
`shouldOverrideUrlLoading` method. This method is called whenever the WebView 
tries to navigate to a different URL. If it returns false, the WebView opens the 
URL itself. (The default implementation _always_ returns false, which is why it 
works in the previous example.)

Create a new class:

1.  Right-click the package name of your app and select **New** > **Java Class**.

    <img src="/multidevice/images/webview/new-java-class.png" alt=""/> 

2.  Enter `MyAppWebViewClient` as the class name and click **OK**. 

3.  In the new `MyAppWebViewClient.java` file, add the following code (changes
    shown in bold):

    <pre>public class MyAppWebViewClient <strong>extends WebViewClient</strong> {
        <strong>
        @Override
        public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) {
            if(Uri.parse(url).getHost().endsWith("html5rocks.com")) {
                return false;
            }
            &nbsp;
            Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url));
            view.getContext().startActivity(intent);
            return true;
        }</strong>
    }
    </pre>

    The new code defines `MyAppWebViewClient` as a subclass of `WebViewClient` and 
    implements the <code>shouldOverrideUrlLoading</code> method.

    The `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` method is called whenever the WebView is about to load a URL.
    This implementation checks for the String "html5rocks.com" at the end of the 
    host name of the URL. If the string exists, the method returns
    false, which tells the platform **not** to override the URL, but to load it in the 
    WebView. 

    For any other hostname, the method makes a request to the system to open the URL. It does 
    this by creating a new Android 
    [Intent](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html) and using it
    to launch a new activity. Returning true at the end of the method  prevents the URL from 
    being loaded into the WebView.

4.  To use your new custom 
    [WebViewClient](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient.html), add
    the following lines to your `MainActivity` class:

    <pre><strong>// Stop local links and redirects from opening in browser instead of WebView
    mWebView.setWebViewClient(new MyAppWebViewClient());
    </strong></pre>

    Now, a user can click any of the HTML5Rocks links and stay within the app, but 
    links to external sites are opened in a browser.

### Handling the Android back button

As you start playing around and navigating the awesome HTML5Rocks articles, 
hitting the back button on Android exits the application, even though you've 
explored a few pages of the site.

To handle the back button correctly, you can use the WebView `canGoBack` method
to determine if there are any pages in the WebView's history. If so, you can
navigate to the previous page. If there's no previous page to go back to, you
can allow the platform to handle the back button.

*   Inside your `MainActivity` class, add the following method (in bold):

    <pre>public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    private WebView mWebView;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        ...
    }
    <strong>    
        @Override
        // Detect when the back button is pressed
        public void onBackPressed() {
            if(mWebView.canGoBack()) {
                mWebView.goBack();
            } else {
                // Let the system handle the back button
                super.onBackPressed();
            }
        }</strong>
        &nbsp;
        @Override
        public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
           ...
        }

    }
    </pre>

## Loading HTML files from the file system

A big advantage of using a WebView inside an installable application is that you 
can store assets inside the app. This lets your app work offline and 
improves load times, since the WebView can retrieve assets directly from the local 
file system.

To store files such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS locally, put them in the 
assets directory. This is a reserved directory that Android uses for raw 
files that your app may need access to (i.e. files it knows it should minimise 
or compress).

In your project, create the <code>assets</code> directory in main (<code>src/main/assets</code>).

Generally it's good practice to keep your web files in a subdirectory, so create 
a www directory and put all your web content in it.

<aside class="note">It's worth noting that absolute paths do not work in the WebView when 
referring to other files, such as CSS and JavaScript. So make sure you make all references 
relative, instead of absolute (for example, instead of  "/pages/somelink.html", use 
"./pages/somelink.html").</aside>

Once you have everything in your assets directory, it's as simple as loading in 
the appropriate file:

<pre><strong>mWebView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/www/index.html");</strong>
</pre>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to tweak the <code>shouldOverrideUrlLoading</code> method so it opens a browser 
for non-local pages:</p>

<pre>public class MyAppWebViewClient extends WebViewClient {
    @Override
    public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) {
        <strong>if(Uri.parse(url).getHost().length() == 0) {</strong>
            return false;
        }

        Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url));
        view.getContext().startActivity(intent);
        return true;
    }

}
</pre>
