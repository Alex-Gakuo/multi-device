<p>Pocket excels at presenting that content in a clean, clutter-free viewing experience across platforms. Still, there are times when users want access to a full browsing experience. In addition, Pocket notes, "Chrome users spend nearly 30% more time in the app than users of the next leading browser."</p>

<p>Chrome <a href="/chrome/mobile/docs/ios-links#callback">callback</a> enables Pocket to pass users seamlessly between Chrome browser and the Pocket app while maintaining Pocket’s simple design. Now, users, which save over 43 million items a month, have a quick and intuitive way to return to the Pocket app while viewing their saved content on the web.</p>

<p>With a growing base of engaged, tech-savvy users, Pocket looks to continue enhancing the way its more than 9.5 million users discover and consume content.</p>
