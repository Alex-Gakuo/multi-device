<h1>Google Chrome for iOS</h1>

<p>Chrome for iOS is designed to be fast. Users search and navigate fast, directly from the same omnibox. Results appear as the user types (prefetching). Users open and quickly switch between an unlimited number of tabs. With sign-in to Chrome, the user's tabs, bookmarks, passwords, and omnibox data sync automatically from other Chrome instances to the iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad, eliminating the delay otherwise inherent with switching between devices. Moreover, the user can send pages from Chrome on the computer to the iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad with one click and read them on the go, even when offline.

<p>Chrome for iOS is derived from the WebKit browser codebase, as is Apple's Mobile Safari. However, while Apple allows only Safari to access iOS facilities like the iOS Nitro engine, Chrome uses Apple's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIWebView_Class/Reference/Reference.html">UIWebView</a> for loading and rendering content. Any of the considerations for UIWebView apply to Chrome for iOS. See the <a href="faq.html">Chrome Mobile FAQ</a> for more information.</p>

<p>There are considerations as well for opening URLs in Chrome for iOS, see <a href="ios-links.html">Opening links in Chrome</a>.</p>
